## PRISM file

The file `heart-disease.dot` models a simplified version of the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic heart disease as described
in [1].

## FSC generation

The FSC is generated by running the following command:

```bash
././build/bin/storm-pomdp --prism heart-disease.nm --prop "Rmin=?[F\"done\"]" --belief-exploration unfold --size-threshold 0 --sound --buildobsval --buildchoicelab --policy-learning  --cutoff-handling cutoffstrategy --export-learned-policy-dot heart-disease.dot

```
The code of the FSC learning tool is available at [2]
